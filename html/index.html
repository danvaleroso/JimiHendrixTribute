                    <p>James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music."</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>He is widely considered to be the greatest guitarist in the history of rock music by other musicians and commentators in the industry, and one of the most important and influential musicians of his era across a range of genres. After initial success in Europe, he achieved fame in the United States following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. Hendrix often favored raw overdriven amplifiers with high gain and treble and helped develop the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback. Hendrix was one of the musicians who popularized the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock which he often used to deliver an exaggerated pitch in his solos, particularly with high bends and use of legato based around the pentatonic scale. He was influenced by blues artists such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Albert King, and Elmore James, rhythm and blues and soul guitarists Curtis Mayfield, Steve Cropper, as well as by some modern jazz. In 1966, Hendrix, who played and recorded with Little Richard's band from 1964 to 1965, was quoted as saying, "I want to do with my guitar what Little Richard does with his voice."</p>

                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Hendrix got into trouble with the law twice for riding in stolen cars.</strong></p>
                        <p>He was given a choice between spending two years in prison or joining the Army. Hendrix chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing boot camp, he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and stationed in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. His commanding officers and fellow soldiers considered him to be a sub-par soldier: he slept while on duty, had little regard for regulations, required constant supervision, and showed no skill as a marksman. For these reasons, his commanding officers submitted a request that Hendrix be discharged from the military after he had served only one year. Hendrix did not object when the opportunity to leave arose. Hendrix would later tell reporters that he received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump. The 2005 biography Room Full of Mirrors by Charles Cross claims that Hendrix faked being homosexual — claiming to have fallen in love with a fellow soldier — in order to be discharged, but has never produced credible evidence to support this contention.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Hendrix signed a three-year recording contract with entrepreneur Ed Chalpin, receiving $1 and 1% royalty.</strong></p>
                        <p>While the relationship with Chalpin was short-lived, his contract remained in force, which caused considerable problems for Hendrix later on in his career. The legal dispute has continued to the present day. During a brief excursion to Vancouver in 1965, it was reported that Hendrix played in the (much later in 1968) Motown band Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers with Taylor and Tommy Chong (of Cheech & Chong fame). Chong, however, disputes this ever happened and that any such appearance is a product of Taylor's "imagination".</p>

                        <p>Released in 1967, it was the first LP for Track Records. The album highlighted Jimi Hendrix's R&B-based, psychedelic, distortion- and feedback-laden electric guitar playing, and launched him as a major new international star. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it #15 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p>

                        <p><strong>Axis: Bold as Love is the second studio album by The Jimi Hendrix Experience.</strong> </p>
                        <p>Under pressure from their record company to follow-up the successful debut of their May 1967 album Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love was released on Track Records in the UK in December 1967. It reached #5 in the UK and later, #3 in the US.</p>
                        <p>The album was recorded to fulfill the band's contract, which stated that they must produce two albums in 1967. Even so, it was not released in the USA until 1968 due to fears that it might have disturbed the sales of the first album. Bassist Noel Redding has noted that this was his favourite of three Experience albums. He plays eight string bass on some tracks.</p>
                        <p>Just before the album's completion, Hendrix left the master tapes of side 1 in a taxi. They were never found again, and thus the A-side had to be mixed again quickly.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Electric Ladyland is the third and final album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, released in 1968 on Reprise Records (see 1968 in music). Produced and mainly written by Jimi Hendrix, the album is seen as the peak of Hendrix's mastery of the electric guitar, and is frequently described as one of the finest albums ever recorded by him[citation needed]. Most of the tracks are Jimi on bass and drums. Many late night hours were spent by Jimi alone refining these tracks. It is not only the last of his albums released as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but also the last of Hendrix's studio albums to be professionally produced under his own supervision. After Electric Ladyland, Hendrix spent the remaining two years of his life attempting to organize a new band and recording a breadth of new songs. The original UK album cover was controversial because it had nude women on the front face. It was later replaced by a front cover made with Jimi Hendrix's face on it.</p>

                        <p>The second and final Love album for Blue Thumb Records saw bandleader Arthur Lee heavily influenced by his friend, Jimi Hendrix, even going so far as to coax Hendrix into appearing on the opening track of the album, "The Everlasting First", supposedly one of several tracks that Hendrix recorded with Love. No further tracks have surfaced, however, possibly due to copyright restrictions or because the tapes have been lost.</p>

                        <p><strong>Early on September 18, 1970, Jimi Hendrix died at the age of 27 in London under circumstances which have never been fully explained.</strong> </p>
                        <p>He had spent the later part of the evening before at a party and was picked up by girlfriend Monika Dannemann and driven to her flat at the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. According to the estimated time of death, from autopsy data and statements by friends about the evening of September 17, he would have died within a few hours after midnight, though no precise estimate was made at the original inquest.</p>
